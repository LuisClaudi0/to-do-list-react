# To-Do List Application

This project was developed by **Luis Cláudio**, using **React & Vite** for the frontend. The goal was to practice my skills in React with Vite.

## 📝 Project Overview

The **To-Do List** allows users to add, complete, search, and delete tasks. Additionally, I used the following libraries to enhance styling and functionality:

- **react-icons**: For beautiful and intuitive icons.
- **hex-to-rgba**: To dynamically adjust task colors with transparency.
- **uuid**: To generate unique IDs for each task.
